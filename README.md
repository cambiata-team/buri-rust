## Name

This language, and all tools descended from the language, will be named after Norse mythology (because why not!?).

In Norse mythology, [BÃºri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BAri) was the first god from which all other gods descended. Likewise, all tools, libraries, and applications in this ecosystem are created from this programming language.
