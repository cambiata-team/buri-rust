Buri is a strongly and statically typed functional programming languages.

- Compile to anywhere (e.g., executable binary or JavaScript)
- Predictable
- Fearless refactoring

It's main goal is to dramatically increase developer velocity.

## Name

This language, and all tools descended from the language, will be named after Norse mythology (because why not!?).

In Norse mythology, [BÃºri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BAri) was the first god from which all other gods descended. Likewise, all tools, libraries, and applications in this ecosystem are created from this programming language.

### Environment setup

#### Using a Codespace

The easiest way to get setup is to start up a new GitHub Codespace. This will ensure you have all the necessary tools and dependencies installed.

#### Developing locally

If you'd rather not use a Codespace, you'll need to install the latest version of the following:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Cargo
- Clippy
- [cargo-cranky](https://github.com/ericseppanen/cargo-cranky)

Then, you can use the following commands:

```sh
cargo build # Build the Buri Rust compiler
cargo test # Run the Buri Rust compiler unit
cargo cranky # Lint the Buri Rust compiler (wraps Clippy)
```

Lastly, ensure you install all the recommended VS Code extensions for an optimal developer experience.
